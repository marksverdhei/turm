This is turm. A rust terminal UI similar to lazydocker for managing slurm.
It calls slurm commands under the hood. Currently, an issue is that it can only be done
on slurm nodes that have it installed. We will add an option to run all slurm commands against
a remote node through ssh. We can do this by prefixing the slurm commands with
the ssh expression, but theres one and possible more caveats:
directories are not remembered between each run, so we must either cd on each command or use abspaths if we use paths.
Envvars must be handled appropriately to determine if they are evaluated on the client side or the server side, if any envvars are used.

You will - modify the code to add this feature in a good, idiomatic way and provide documentation / instructions to configure a remote ssh cluster.
